    <p>This project involved the comprehensive testing of a library management system, focusing on multiple testing methodologies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Specification-Based Testing:</strong> Boundary value and equivalence testing to ensure the systemâ€™s correctness.</li>
      <li><strong>Code-Based Testing:</strong> Achieved 100% line coverage, ensuring all parts of the code were verified.</li>
      <li><strong>Integration Testing:</strong> Verified the interaction between different modules within the system.</li>
      <li><strong>Mock Testing:</strong> Simulated external dependencies to test isolated modules.</li>
      <li><strong>Basis Path Testing:</strong> Ensured all control paths were covered.</li>
      <li><strong>Mutation Testing:</strong> Verified the robustness of the code by introducing variations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Technologies and tools used in this project included Java, JavaFX, and various testing frameworks to ensure a reliable and efficient system.</p>
