            <p>
              I'm a software engineering graduate with a passion for programming
              and problem-solving. I have experience as a Junior Consultant for
              Banking Applications at Facilization and have completed various
              projects, including emotion recognition using EEG signals for my
              thesis. Currently, I am enhancing my skills through a React
              bootcamp at Teamsystem in Tirana. I am eager to explore
              opportunities in software development and AI.
